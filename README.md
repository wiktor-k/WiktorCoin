# WiktorCoin

This project implements a sample coin based on the [Move tutorial](https://github.com/move-language/move/tree/main/language/documentation/tutorial).

One addition over the tutorial is automatic CI configuration to build and test the coin and serves as a test for both this sample project and Move tooling.

See [First impressions of the Move programming language](https://brson.github.io/2022/09/21/move-impressions) for more details about Move.

## Note

This is a work in progress!
